1. Core Functionalities
User Management: Focus on securing user data and implementing multiple sign-up/login methods. JWT for authentication is great. You might also want to think about email verification and password reset functionalities.

Property Listings Management: This will require CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for properties. Be sure to implement validation for property details.

Search and Filtering: Efficient search algorithms and pagination for filtering properties are crucial for a smooth user experience.

Booking Management: Youâ€™ll need to implement booking logic that handles date validation and prevents double bookings.

Payment Integration: Payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal will require setting up APIs and making sure payments are processed securely.

Reviews and Ratings: Associating reviews with bookings is important to prevent spam and ensure credibility.

Notifications System: Implementing an email and in-app notification system can be handled through third-party services like SendGrid or Firebase.

Admin Dashboard: Create administrative tools to monitor and manage the backend activities, and ensure proper roles and permissions for each type of user.

2. Technical Requirements
Database Management: PostgreSQL or MySQL are great choices. Ensure you have proper relationships between tables (e.g., Users, Properties, Bookings, Reviews).

API Development: RESTful APIs for CRUD operations, and possibly GraphQL for more complex data fetching scenarios.

Authentication and Authorization: JWT for authentication and role-based access control to differentiate between user types.

File Storage: Use cloud storage like AWS S3 to handle user and property images.

Third-Party Services: Email services like SendGrid or Mailgun will be crucial for notifications.

Error Handling and Logging: Consider using tools like Winston or Morgan for logging, and centralized error handling.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
Scalability: Modular architecture and load balancing are key to handle increased traffic.

Security: Secure sensitive data with encryption, use HTTPS, and protect against malicious activities with firewalls and rate limiting.

Performance Optimization: Implement caching with tools like Redis to improve response times.

Testing: Unit and integration testing using frameworks like pytest is important. Automated API testing will ensure all endpoints are functioning properly.
